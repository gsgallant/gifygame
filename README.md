This was a cool project to do and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was able to stretch my creative muscles while also using some new programming skills.  I found myself thinking about this game even when I wasn't coding.  I kept on conceiving of other functionality that I wanted to try putting into the code and that is why the extra buttons are there.
